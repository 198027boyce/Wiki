###User Accounts

MediaBrowser allows for multiple user accounts, each with their own access rights and privileges. These users will have separate watched states for your media, and depending on the access you allow them, may or may not be able to "manage" the server. You can create user accounts for children, and set the parental controls to restrict content of an Adult rating. Perhaps you have media content such as 3D in a separate library, and wish to "hide" this content from a user account that doesn't have access to a 3D display. User accounts allow you to determine what a user can see and how they can control it. Note that you should always have one user account that is allowed to manage the server.

###Creating a User Account

During the installation process, you will have already set up a user account. This user account will already have access to manage your MediaBrowser server. If you want to create further accounts you will need to open the MediaBrowser Server Web Client and view your Dashboard. 

1.) From the Dashboard, select users from the menu. 

2.) On the Users page, you'll see a list of your current user accounts, both local Users and Guests.

3.) Select/Click on the + symbol next to the User account type you wish to create. We will create a local user by clicking on the + symbol next **Users**.

4.) The **New User** page will be displayed. Give your new account an appropriate name.

5.) If you want this user to have different access rights to your media, you can expand the **Library Access** and check/uncheck the appropriate Media Folders. You can also give access to channels such as Trailers with the **Channel Access**.

6.) At the bottom of the page, don't forget to save your new User Account.


###Editing a User Account

Under the User accounts tab, select the User Account you wish to edit. You'll be presented with a page with 4 tabs; **Profile**, **Library Access**, **Parental Control** and **Password**.

##Profile

The profile page allows you to change the account name, enter a username or email address for use with MediaBrowser Connect and dictate Feature access. Under Advanced Control, you can disable the user account, disable access to user preferences and Hide the user from the login screens; useful if you want a hidden "Admin" account.

##Library Access

Library Access lets you select the media folders you wish to share with the user.

##Parental Control

As the name suggests, Parental Control allows you to restrict content based on your media's parental rating. E.g. hiding all Adult rated content from a childrens account. MediaBrowser is locale aware, so your media should be rated for the country/rating system applicable to you. You can also block items with no rating of specific media types, and restrict content based on tags, e.g. hiding all content tagged "3D" from a user without access to a 3D display.

##Password

Here you can configure the account's Password. Note that many MediaBrowser clients allow you to access your account without a password or with a pre-configured password whilst on the local network.

###MediaBrowser Connect

MediaBrowser allows you to access your media while away from home. A simple way to do this is to enter your servers WAN ip address (not your server machines local IP) into a browser, but you can also use the MediaBrowser web app, Connect. Using Connect means you won't need to remember your IP address, and connect from any web browser via the hosted MediaBrowser app. 

To allow a user to use the Connect function, you'll first need to create an online account. Go to http://http://app.mediabrowser.tv and sign up for an account. Alternatively, you can go straight to the MediaBrowser forums (http://http://mediabrowser.tv/community/) and sign up for an account there.

When your account is created, return to your MediaBrowser Server Dashboard. Select the Users option from the side menu and edit the account you wish to link to your online Connect account. On the **Profile** page, simply enter the Username or Email address you signed up with. Click save, and confirm the account is linked by selecting Users from the side menu once more. You should now see a green circle with a white cloud in the top right of the Connected user.

###Guests

MediaBrowser allows you to share your Server with "Guests". To Create a Guest account and invite someone, you will first need to make sure the account you are logged in with is linked via **Connect**. Once this is done, you will also require the Username (forum name) of the user you wish to invite. 

1.) Open the Dashboard and select **Users** from the side menu.

2.) Click on the + symbol next to **Guests**.

3.) Enter the username of the user you wish to **Invite**. Don't forget to check their access privileges; you may not want the invited user to be able to view your Photos or Home Movies, so select which media you are sharing before you Invite them.
4.) An invited user can now login via the web app, at which point they will be asked which server they wish to access (assuming they have access to more than one).

Each individual client will have there own (but similar) ways of accessing different servers, so be sure to check those clients instructions if required.
